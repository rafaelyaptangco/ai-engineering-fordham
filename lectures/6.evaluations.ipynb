Because the LLM generates questions using the document's own vocabulary, making them easier to retrieve via embedding similarity. Real user queries are messier and more diverse. This is an important caveat: **synthetic evals can overestimate your system's real-world performance**. They're great when you have no ground truth at all, but treat the numbers as an upper bound."

Since we only retrieve up to k=20, we can't possibly find them all — so recall values will be low. This is expected and not a problem with our search system. In practice, **precision tells us about the quality of our top results** (are the docs we return actually useful?), while recall tells us how much of the total relevant information we're capturing. Both matter, but for RAG — where we feed a handful of documents to an LLM — precision is usually more important."
